# Autonomous-Line-Following-Robot-with-Unloading-Mechanism-and-Obstacle-Avoidance
This is the project for my Microcontrollers and Interfacing course. 

I made an Autonomous Line Following Robot using Arduino Uno. The robot's line following mode used two IR Sensors to stay on the line. 
The robot has the option to switch to manual mode where it can be controlled using any bluetooth device. 
The robot detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor.
At the end of the line, the robot has the ability to drop a ball into a container placed in front of it.
